                    <p>
                        Ray and Charles Eames laid the foundation for modern design and created work that has transcended time. 
                        With an aspiration to bring the Eameses’ timeless methodologies to a modern audience, the Eames Institute enlisted Instrument to co-create a digital platform to unveil their vast collection to the world.

                    <p>
                        To evolve and mature how Dropbox engages with their customers, we developed a multi-year brand platform as well as launched its first campaign titled 'For All Things Worth Saving' — an ecosystem of branded experiences aimed to remind people of the inherent value of their digital files.
